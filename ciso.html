      <h1>Does your company currently have a CISO?</h1>
      <p>Security is one of the fastest-evolving and most complex areas of information technology and a critical concern for companies in just about every industry. Threats to the security of data are increasing and organizations continue to struggle with the changing security landscape and regulations. Sadly, security incidents and data breaches are becoming commonplace in business today.</p>
      <p>Companies are realizing the need for a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), responsible for security.  It is also important to have an executive responsible for making security decisions and educating the management team on risks.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, few companies have a dedicated CISO who is responsible for security within the organization.</p><br>
      <h4>What is the role of a CISO?</h4>
      <p>The CISO advises the executive team on how the organization needs to meet security requirements to do business in their given industry. The CISO oversees a team that has a view of the risks facing the enterprise and puts in place the necessary security technologies and processes to minimize the risks to the organization. They are empowered to communicate risks to decisions makers and take action independently when necessary. They also advocate for investment and resources to ensure security practices are given appropriate attention.</p><br>

      <h4>Chief Information Officer (CISO) as a service.</h4>
