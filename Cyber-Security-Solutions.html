The CISO oversees a team that has a view of the risks facing the enterprise and puts in place the necessary security technologies and processes to minimize the risks to the organization. They are empowered to communicate risks to decisions makers and take action independently when necessary. They also advocate for investment and resources to ensure security practices are given appropriate attention.</p>

         <p>Many companies today are saving money by outsourcing aspects of their IT support. AgileSecOps offers a wide variety of managed services. The following is just an example of what we can do for your company.</p>
            <h1>Cloudflare Implementation and Management</h1>
            <p>Cloudflare offers some of the most advanced CDN, WAF, and other capabilities to secure and enhance your website.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Install, configure, and maintain a domain or multi-domain environment.</li>

              <li>Recommend features that will work to accelerate your website and overall customer experience.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>***Just recently, we implemented Cloudflare for a fortune 500 that was under a denial of service attack. The total implementation time was less than one day. Their site is totally operational and operating at a more efficient rate than prior to the attack. This attack was against the logic of the site. The Web Application Firewall that Cloudflare offers took care of the attack in this situation. We were able to properly identify the rules and put them in place without interrupting valid users of the site.</p>

          <p>Vulnerability management is the process in which vulnerabilities in IT are identified and the risks of these vulnerabilities are evaluated.

        <h1 style="color: darkred">Compliance</h1>
      <p>Almost every organization has to deal with some sort of compliance. It may be mandated upon them by an overseeing body. This might be something along the lines of the Payment Card Industry and their PCI-DSS compliance. Or, an organization may want to become compliant in order to have the advantage on their competition. Customers like the feeling that their data is being secured to the best of the industries abilities and they tend to go with companies that can prove it.</p>
      <p>There are so many different compliances out there. Regardless of what sector your business operates in we can help. We will help you meet the regulation or guideline that your industry and customers demand.</p>
      <p>The following are some of the assessments we perform:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Information Security and Operational assessments</li>
