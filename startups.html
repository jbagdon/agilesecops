          <p>Startup companies need IT infrastructure and security, and that's what we live and breathe at AgileSecOps.  The LAMP stack, AWS, and open source are a few of the technologies we are passionate about.  We are fanatics about DevOps, a must for successful startups today.  We are also well-versed in the payment card industry and many other security standards such as HIPAA, ISO 27001, and GDPR.</p>

          <p>Letting us assist you in these areas lets you focus on your core business and gets you there faster.</p>

          <p>Our skill set encompasses many verticals, including web technologies, healthcare, finance, hospitality, education, energy and utilities, science, and government. We have a talented staff of engineers that love the challenge, excitement, and fast pace of working on new ventures.</p>

          <p>Security is a very hot topic today. It can ruin a company if not done correctly. Most startups don't really think about security until the later stages and then it's bolted on in a way that looks and feels messy. You just can't bolt on a security program and call it good. Something that works well for one company might not be the best for another. Security is something that works best when it's engrained into the culture. People adopt it because they believe in it and understand it. AgileSecOps specializes in helping companies with security direction and guidance. I call it <a href="ciso.html"><b>CISO as a Service</b></a>.</p>
          <p>CISO as a Service is like having an attorney on call. You don't need one full-time yet, but you could really use the advice at certain times. We can help you position yourself, in regards to security and compliance, to get ahead of your competition.</p>
          <p>Within the CISO as a Service engagement, we can assist with any Information Security or Information Technology need that your company might have. AgileSecOps performs all sorts of work ranging from creating policies/procedures, compliance, and even implementing security on systems.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the other services, in addition to the security aspect, that AgileSecOps offers. We provide deep discounts for startups and believe that we can help accelerate their business.</p>
