      <p>Startup companies need IT infrastructure and security, and that's what we live and breathe at AgileSecOps.

          <p>Our skill set encompasses many verticals, including web technologies, healthcare, finance, hospitality, education, energy and utilities, science, and government. We have a talented staff of engineers that love the challenge, excitement, and fast pace of working on new ventures.</p>

          <p>Security is a very hot topic today. It can ruin a company if not done correctly. Most startups don't really think about security until the later stages and then it's bolted on in a way that looks and feels messy. You just can't bolt on a security program and call it good. Something that works well for one company might not be the best for another. Security is something that works best when it's ingrained into the culture. People adopt it because they believe in it and understand it. AgileSecOps specializes in helping companies with security direction and guidance. I call it <a href="ciso.html">CISO as a Service</a>.</p>
          <p>CISO as a Service is like having an attorney on call. You don't need one full-time yet, but you could really use the advice at certain times. We can help you position yourself, in regards to security and compliance, to get ahead of your competition.</p>
          <p>Within the CISO as a Service engagement, we can assist with any Information Security or Information Technology need that your company might have. AgileSecOps performs all sorts of work ranging from creating policies/procedures, compliance, and even implementing security on systems.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the other services, in addition to the security aspect, that AgileSecOps offers. We provide deep discounts for startups and believe that we can help accelerate their business.</p>

    <p>Regardless of their size, businesses today are permeated by technology, and it’s often the case that they do not have the internal resources required to stay on top of upcoming trends, required IT standards, or the latest security vulnerabilities and risks. By partnering with AgileSecOps, these organizations can expand their internal IT teams to include engineers who will gain a deep understanding of the client’s business and provide them with technical leadership in several key areas:</p>
    </div>
        </div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm" style="padding-right: 20px;">
    <h1>System Visibility</h1>
    <p>One challenge that organizations face is how to gain visibility into their IT systems and resources. Many times, businesses want to see the status of their technical resources from multiple perspectives. They need to know whether their web sites are vulnerable, what risks are inherent in their applications, and how well their internal IT systems are architected and operating. AgileSecOps has the expertise to give clients the IT visibility they need to make strategic and tactical decisions.</p>
    <h1>Server Vulnerability</h1>
    <p>Companies with servers that are accessible through the Internet can be vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. AgileSecOps can provide clients with peace of mind about the security of such servers by performing external vulnerability assessments to pinpoint specific risks and identifying how to best protect their systems.</p>
    <h1>Software Security</h1>
    <p>Companies that are in the technology business, particularly those that develop their own software for either internal or commercial use, often come to AgileSecOps to get an external perspective on the security or performance of these tools. AgileSecOps will take an objective look at the software using industry best practices and standards, and will make recommendations about how to effectively and practically improve the security and performance of the architecture.</p>
    <p>These projects, in conjunction with an internal security assessment, can give an organization a cohesive look at its existing IT posture. Understanding security from within the organization is key, as it can help businesses fortify themselves from the inside, dramatically strengthening their overall security position.</p>
    <h1>Employee Education</h1>
    <p>Workers may not know how to avoid phishing and other types of attacks. Investing in regular security training is a great way to prevent attacks.</p>
    <h1>Beware of Ransomware</h1>
    <p>The U.S. is consistently one of the most phished nations, and phishing can lead to ransomware. AgileSecOps can assist in creating a layered defense by implementing strong backup and business continuity plans.</p>

    <p>As technology changes the way students learn, teachers teach, and administrators manage their schools and districts, AgileSecOps is there to serve as a valued partner to enable educational organizations to take advantage of technological advances quickly and effectively.</p>

    <p>For many educational organizations and institutions, technology is perceived as a burden—at least when it comes to the need for ongoing maintenance and attention. And sometimes, these organizations simply do not have the resources or expertise required for regular IT maintenance, let alone the resources—or expertise—necessary for implementing initiatives. At AgileSecOps, we have the resources you need: We can assess your organization’s existing environment and make practical recommendations that take into account the realities and challenges you face. If you wish, AgileSecOps can implement the changes we’ve recommended, and we are also available to help with day-to-day operations if you do not have the desire or resources to handle it yourselves.</p>

        <div class="col-sm" style="padding-right: 20px;">
    <p>Some educational organizations, however, are technology companies at heart, whose business is to deliver educational material, or whose primary clients are educators. These organizations also look to AgileSecOps to apply our best-practices expertise to their technical infrastructure. AgileSecOps can work with the organization's staff to evaluate and improve both the security and the performance of key resources.</p>

    <p>The hospitality (aka tourism) industry is one of the main drivers of growth in many economies and depends largely on the availability of leisure time and disposable income; in the United States alone it’s a several-billion-dollar-a-year industry. With so many people taking advantage of the Internet to plan and book their own vacations and leisure activities, it is critical that organizations in this space be able to provide secure and efficient online experiences to their customers.</p> 
    <p>AgileSecOps serves as a trusted partner to hospitality organizations to ensure that they leverage IT infrastructure and security to appropriately meet their customers’ online experience needs.</p>
    </div>
        </div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm" style="padding: 20px;">
    <p>In addition to being able to offer customers the ability to securely and efficiently book lodging, dining, and adventure activities such as skiing or a round of golf, hospitality vendors whose sites handle credit card information are also required to comply with industry regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). AgileSecOps is here to help our hospitality clients both meet and maintain PCI compliance.</p>
    <p>Other AgileSecOps services that can help hospitality vendors maximize their online customer experience investment dollars include the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Application security assessment</li>
    <li>Penetration testing.</li>
    <li>Scalability/capacity planning</li>
    <li>Web infrastructure</li></ul>
