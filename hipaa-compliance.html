      <h1>HIPAA Compliance</h1>
      <h3>How is your business doing in regards to HIPAA compliance?</h3>

          <p>HIPAA is like so many other compliance initiatives where companies perform what's required, check all the boxes, and move on with their everyday business. I find that a lot of companies maybe setup a program and did the initial investment to become compliant but many have slipped since and are no longer doing what they should. The truth is that we should be doing so much more than just complying with HIPAA.</p>
          <p>Some recent news articles point out issues with maintaining a secure environment for healthcare data:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><a href="http://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-data-security-incidents-second-highest-in-2016">Symantec found that healthcare data security incidents in 2016 were the second highest in the services sector, with reported breaches increasing 22 percent.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/04/27/healthcare-providers-cannot-complacent-data-security/">However, another 13% have experienced a breach of their healthcare data, with over half (56%) becoming the victims of medical identity theft.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/the-health-care-data-breach-a-tale-of-big-expenses-and-cheap-sales/">Healthcare data breaches are on the rise. There were 39 reported health network compromises in March, totaling more than 1.5 million records. This not only surpasses the 31 total events reported in both January and February, but also more than triples the 388,000 records breached in 2017’s first month.</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some things to think about:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>How is your company doing with maintaining a HIPAA program?</li>
          <li>Is your company going beyond HIPAA and providing extra protection to healthcare data?</li>
          <li>How long has it been since a 3rd party has audited your HIPAA program?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you feel like you should be doing more, then maybe it's time for a 3rd party to come in and take a look. <strong>AgileSecOps can assist in performing a gap analysis of your HIPAA compliance and of your operational environment.</strong> <a href="contact.html">Call or email</a> us today so we can discuss next steps.</p>
