    <h1>Cloudflare Implementation and Management</h1>
    <p>Cloudflare offers some of the most advanced CDN, WAF, and other capabilities to secure and enhance your website.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Install, configure, and maintain a domain or multi-domain environment.</li>
              <li>Provide advanced configuration and tuning to ensure the maximum uptime of your site.</li>
              <li>Recommend features that will work to accelerate your website and overall customer experience.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>The cost for setup and management is $125/hr. The customer is responsible for the actual cost of Cloudflare.</p>
            <p>***Just recently, we implemented Cloudflare for a fortune 500 that was under a denial of service attack. The total implementation time was less than one day. Their site is totally operational and operating at a more efficient rate than prior to the attack. This attack was against the logic of the site. The Web Application Firewall that Cloudflare offers took care of the attack in this situation. We were able to properly identify the rules and put them in place without interrupting valid users of the site.</p>
