    <h1>Verodin - A product worth looking at.</h1>

    <p>A couple weeks ago I found myself at a lunch and learn and the vendor was Verodin. I have to admit that I hadn't even heard of this company or what they were up to as far as product development. However, what I saw in their presentation was absolutely revolutionary.</p>
    <p>It is definitely worth looking at their website to check out exactly what they do and how they do it. However, they basically have a capability to test attacks live in your environment. After the attacks are done they can tell if they were blocked, if they were seen, and they can provide exactly what adjustments you need to make in your environment (i.e. change a rule in a firewall or IDS) in order to detect and block the attack.</p>
    <p>Normally, the issue I see in organizations is that the Security department will spend a lot of money putting solutions in place but never perform any tuning to make them effective. With the use of Verodin's capability, the Security department can constantly be testing and adjusting their appliances or software solutions. By doing this it keeps your company ahead of the threat and at a lower risk of being compromised by a malicious actor.</p>

    <h1>Consumers want more IT Security</h1>
    <p>April 16, 2018</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12">
   <p>A recent poll, performed by IBM, showed that consumers where lacking trust in companies and wanted more Cyber Security to protect the products they are buying. I'm not sure what products are on the consumer's mind when they were asked these questions. However, I would guess they ranged from online SaaS services to the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
    <img src="images/ibm-survey.jpg" alt="IBM Survey" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:20px;">
    <p>Reading this survey really struck home. When I purchased my current home a couple of years ago ADT wanted me to update my current security system with their new Internet-connected Pulse system. When I started asking questions to the sales representative about how they secure their product from hackers I got a blank stare. I asked if they performed any penetration testing or had any certifications from any well known IT Security organizations in regards to the security of their own system. He didn't know but put me in touch with their support team who told me that I wasn't supposed to be talking directly to them. As you can imagine, without getting the satisfaction of knowing the system that I was being offered was secured, I didn't buy it.</p>
    <p>I believe that more people are starting to realize the importance of IT Security in the products of the marketplace. Business need to step it up a notch and add cybersecurity to their products in order to protect customers data and safety.</p>
