      <h1>Email Etiquette Gone Wrong</h1>
      <p>Aug 09, 2017</p>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3" >
          <img src="images/email.jpg" alt="The Patch Cycle" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:5px 5px;">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-9" style="padding:0px 20px;">
            <p>I felt the need to point out to a few people the correct way of using email. This isn't anything new but for some, it tends to be very difficult.</p>

            <p>This morning a recruiter sent out an email to a bunch of people by placing all of the individual's email addresses in the CC field. This was the first mistake. When emailing many people that don't know each other put them all in the BCC field. This way the recipients don't know who else the email went to. This is the original email from the recruiter:</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12" >
        <img src="images/email-1.JPG" alt="From the recruiter" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:5px 20px;">
        <p>Next, when replying to such an email don't reply to all. This can cause other problems like people not liking your response or something else. In this case, it was that an individual had passed his CISSP test but hadn't yet been signed off by another CISSP and had his new cert in his signature line. The following was the first reply to all sent from who I believe is part of a local ISC Chapter:</p>
        <img src="images/email-2.JPG" alt="From ISC member" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:5px 20px;">
        <p>What happened from here was a local ISC2 chapter president started an email chain (reply to all...didn't I say not to do that) dragging this young man over the coals for putting his cert in his signature block prior to being officially signed off. Now, I know what the young man did was not correct. However, an ISC2 chapter president acting high and mighty to all in the email list probably isn't the best way to mentor a new CISSP. The following is from the President of a local ISC Chapter (this was also a reply to all):</p>
        <img src="images/email-3.JPG" alt="From ISC Chapter President" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:5px 20px;">
        <p>Finally, don't put in writing what you don't want others to see. When I asked to stop the reply to all or I would complain to the ISC Mr. President told me that my threats hold no weight. Having everything in writing I wrote a formal complaint, had it notarized (they really should make the process easier), and sent it priority mail to the ISC2 complaints department.</p>
        <img src="images/email-4.JPG" alt="From ISC Chapter President" class="center-block img-responsive" style="padding:5px 20px;">
        <p>Lessons learned:</p>
        <ol><li>Use BCC and not CC when emailing a bunch of strangers or a group of people within your organization.</li>
        <li>Don't reply to all if you are only talking to one person.</li>
        <li> Don't put in a written format something that might come back to bite you in the end.</li>
        <li>AND, people in the position of authority should mentor others and not drag them over the coals when they make a mistake.</li></ol>
